// Premise: Consider the amount of downtime vs. productive time, and create a score based on that
// Given school takes up 31.25 hours in a week (6.25 * 5), individuals should find a balance of
// Working on school work and finding time to themselves; this can be defined by some equation down the
// line
// The score would be low if an individual works too much, or too little (so ig parabolic relation?)
// hobbies and downtime would count towards relax-time, and non-negotiables and assignments would count
// toward productive time.
